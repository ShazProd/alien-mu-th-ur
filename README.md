Welcome to the Alien-Mu-Th-Ur module for ALIEN RPG by Free league and Foundry VTT, which simulates an interface between a player and Mother.

Once activated in Foundry VTT, the module will open when a player decides to activate it or when the GM authorises it. It can be found in the notes with a ROBOT logo.

I invite you to have a look at the settings, which allow you to modify certain aspects of the module, such as whether or not hacking is allowed, or whether the hacking attempt succeeds, fails or is random. As well as the activation of the Cerberus protocol and the time remaining before explosion.

The list of complete orders is supplied to the GM when the module is opened

it allows you to type several commands on the player side with automatic responses. such as :

command visible to the player :

STATUS: the status of the Mu-Th-Ur interface

HELP: list of player commands

/M message : type the /m command followed by the message for Mother (mum can reply at this point)

CLEAR: delete the chat

EXIT : close the chat

command not visible to the player but can launch :

special order : an automatic response for all special orders such as 754, 899, 931, 937, 939, 966 indicating that the player does not have administrator rights.

Cerberus: an automatic response indicating that the player does not have administrator rights.

HACK : which triggers a hack attempt on the player's side to increase their privileges and obtain additional commands or additional responses from mum.

Once the hack has been successfully completed, the special order and cerberus commands are valid and, in the case of the special orders, they will generate automatic responses related to the Alien universe.

As for Cerberus, it triggers the base's self-destruct system, and the player must validate the order. When he does, the chosen countdown begins and at zero everyone is dead. But the GM has a button to stop the countdown.
